# DungeonDex Current Notes

## Source of Truth
- GitHub folder is the active source of truth.
- VERSION.md is the active version authority.
- CHANGELOG.md is the permanent update history.
- Do not use old zip names, old release-note filenames, old cache labels, or old smoke-test files as version authority.

## Current Workflow
- Inspect files before editing.
- Keep updates small and reviewable.
- Do not create a new zip/package unless explicitly requested.
- Do not rename the project folder.
- Preserve save compatibility whenever possible.
- Summarize changed files after every pass.
- Include smoke-test steps before commit.

## Player-Facing Labels
- Keep visible labels short and clean.
- Use labels like “DungeonDex v1.4.11”.
- Do not show long internal pass names in the game UI.
- Long names belong only in changelog notes, commit messages, or internal comments.

## UI Direction
- Mobile-first.
- Compact panels.
- Fast repeat play.
- Clear gear readability.
- Less repeated combat text.
- Stable town/combat layout.
- Avoid clutter.

## Release Notes
- Add finished update notes to CHANGELOG.md.
- Do not create new PATCH_NOTES_1_4_X files.
- Keep VERSION.md updated when starting a new version target.
